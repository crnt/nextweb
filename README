Nextweb is a modern web framework for C++ and python. It is completely
different from Django and others because it was designed and developed 
essentially for high-loaded sites.

Four main parts of this framework are:

 * precompiled templates, which are efficient, modular and extensible
   with token rewriting mechanism

 * fastcgi server, implemening different request handling stratgies
   including "thread pool", "thread per request" of "web-server spawned"

 * user input checking functions

 * common facilities, such as efficient authorization checker or IP to
   region mapping, and respective services built on top of these 
   facilities.

Not all of the parts are completed yet :)
